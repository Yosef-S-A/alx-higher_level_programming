# 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
In this project, I started using conditionals and loops in Python by using ```if```, ```if...else```, ```break```, ```continue```, ```pass```, ```range``` statements. In addition, I also started utilizing ```while``` and ```for``` loops. I practiced writing my own functions while learning about variable scope, arithmetic and tracebacks.

## Tasks :clipboard:

### 0.[Positive anything is better than negative nothing](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/0-positive_or_negative.py)

This Python script identifies whether a randomly generated signed number is positive or negative.

### 1.[The last digit](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/1-last_digit.py)

A script that print the last digit of a randomly generated number.

### 2.[I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/2-print_alphabet.py)

A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### 3.[When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/3-print_alphabt.py)

A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
  + Prints all the letters except q and e

### 4.[Hexadecimal printing](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/4-print_hexa.py)

A program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.

### 5.[00...99](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/5-print_comb2.py)

A program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 separated by ',' and no new line.

### 6.[Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/6-print_comb3.py)

A program that prints all possible different combination of two digits.

  + The two digits must be different
  + ```01``` and ```10``` are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
  + The smallest combinations are only printed

### 7.[islower](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/7-islower.py)

A function that checks for lowercase character using the ```ord()``` function. 
  ***test cases were provided by holberton***
 
 + Function prototype is:
   ```def islower(c):```

### 8.[To uppercase](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/8-uppercase.py)

A function that prints a string in uppercse followed by a new line.

  + ```ord()``` is used.

  + Function prototype is:
    ```def uppercase(str):```

  + ```isupper``` and ```upper()``` from ```str``` module is not used
