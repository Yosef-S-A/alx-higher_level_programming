# 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
In this project, I started using conditionals and loops in Python by using ```if```, ```if...else```, ```break```, ```continue```, ```pass```, ```range``` statements. In addition, I also started utilizing ```while``` and ```for``` loops. I practiced writing my own functions while learning about variable scope, arithmetic and tracebacks.

This Python script identifies whether a randomly generated signed number is positive or negative.
